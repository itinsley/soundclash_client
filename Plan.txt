1. React integration with Facebook  on soundclash.test:3000 ✔
2. CORS - hacked with wildcards ✔
3. Can you get a session ID from soundclash
9. Unhack the CORS

Give up on CORS. Try proxy instead!
1. Cloudfront setup with reverse proxy to soundcla.sh http://d1o1q2d9vd24.cloudfront.net
2. DNS client.soundcla.sh now points to soundcla.sh which effectively means I can host client.soundcla.sh from soundclash-client.herokuapp.com I think.
2.5 Do I even need cloudfront then? Can't I just point my client. cname directly to a heroku app?

Friday last thoughts - maybe I don't need this local proxy
1. Can I proxy local client to locahost:3001/api
2. Can I proxy local client to soundcla.sh/api
3. Can I run client from client.soundcla.sh or soundcla.sh/beta and /api routes will be fine and won't need proxying

Didn't work

- Using the create-react-app proxy setting only seems to allow cookies to be set if we are proxying to another localhost. i.e if I proxy to soundclash.test that is an alias to localhost, then it will not set cookies. All this puts the session stuff in the too hard basket, especialy when combined with proxying.

Propose - continue to proxy - to avoid CORS issues. But use a JWT.
